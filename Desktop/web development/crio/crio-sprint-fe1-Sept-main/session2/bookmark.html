              World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler
              system for transforming your life. He knows that lasting change
              comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions
              doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding
              a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.
